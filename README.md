# The Odin Project - WebDev training
## Rock-Paper-Scissors game

My first more serious project involving JS, HTML and CSS.

First version of this project will be console application, which later will be developed to use User Interface.

I slightly modified genuine idea of rock/paper/scissors to include three nature elements.
This should be more fun to play.

Things I learned during first, console part:
* Refreshed knowledge of basic webpage structure;
* Learned how to adapt functions to my needs;

To do:
* Implement UI and make everything working together
