# Rock-Paper-Scissors game
This is my first more serious project involving JS, HTML and CSS.

First version of this project was a console application, but currently is available with GUI.

**Live version** of the game is [here](https://dariuszgros.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

I slightly modified genuine idea of rock/paper/scissors to include three nature elements.
This should be more fun to play.

## Things I learned during first, console part:
* Refreshed knowledge of basic webpage structure;
* Learned how to adapt functions to my needs;

## Things I learned while making UI:
* Learned how to use and adapt **Fonts Awesome Icons** to me needs.
* Learned how to apply **CSS** to make it work better.
* Improved my JavaScript knowledge (breaking functions into a smaller ones, calling, invoking, organization etc.)
